# Company Policies

## 1. Attendance
All employees are required to clock in by 9:00 AM. Late arrivals over 15 minutes count as a tardy. Three consecutive tardies will result in a formal warning. Remote employees must log attendance through the system daily.

## 2. Leave Procedures
Employees must submit leave requests via the HR portal at least one week in advance, specifying the type of leave and duration. Supervisors are responsible for approving all requests. Emergency leaves must be reported as soon as possible.

## 3. Rewards & Disciplinary Actions
High-performing employees may receive quarterly bonuses, stock options, or additional leave days. Violations of company policies may result in verbal warnings, written warnings, or salary deductions, depending on severity.

## 4. Confidentiality
Employees must not disclose any company trade secrets, client information, or R&D data. Confidentiality obligations remain in effect after termination of employment. Sharing internal documents externally without authorization is strictly prohibited.

## 5. Remote Work
Employees may request remote work days following approval by their manager. All company devices must adhere to IT security policies, including encryption and secure VPN usage.
